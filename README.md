## Description
* Our goal is to investigate, explore and develop a general protocol for transmitting information to IOT devices.
* The protocol will promote the transmission of information in a minimal, efficient and real-time manner.
* Anathor goal in this project ,is to enable a system operation (which consists of sensors and IOT chips) as normal and as clean as possible.
* Our desire is that the information will be transferred only when necessary and perceived as an exceptional situation in the system and requires human intervention.
* The protocol will operate independently and completely autonomously.
* Our thoughts are that the protocol activity will help save the cost of advanced and powerful storage servers and also use satellites for systems that use this communication networks.



## Tools & Practices
We're trying to use the best tools and practices in order to produce a quality enginneered product.
